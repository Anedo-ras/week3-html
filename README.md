## ðŸ›  How to Experiment

You can open `styles.css` and:
- Increase `padding` in `.spaced` to see more inner space.
- Increase `margin` in `.margined` to push it away from others.
- Change `border` width/style in `.bordered` for visual effect.
- Modify `background` colors to better visualize the box model.
